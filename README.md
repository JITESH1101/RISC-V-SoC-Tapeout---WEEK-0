# RISC-V-SoC-Tapeout---WEEK-0

For First Week, we have an introduction to SoC Design Flow and installation of tools like Yosys, iverilog and gtkwave.

# SoC Design Flow Overview

This flow explains how a System-on-Chip (SoC) moves from specifications to real-world applications:

- Chip Modeling (O1):- Define specs in a C model with C-based testbenches for functional verification.
- RTL Design (O2):– Describe the hardware using RTL (Verilog), covering processors, peripherals, and IPs.
- SoC Integration (O3):– Combine gate-level netlists, synthesized macros, analog IPs, and GPIOs into a unified SoC.
- Final Chip (O4):– The integrated design runs at real operating frequencies (e.g., 100–130 MHz) and is verified again with C-based testbenches.

After ASIC synthesis and RTL-to-GDSII (RTL2GDS) flow—which includes floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis, routing, and DRC/LVS checks—the final GDSII is sent for fabrication.
The end result is silicon chips powering real products like iWatches, Arduino boards, TV panels, and AC controllers.

# Tool Installations

System Specification check:-
Required specifications to run all these tools and for future tasks are
- 6GB RAM, 50 GB HDD
- Ubuntu 20.04+
- 4vCPU

After confirming that my system is capable of handling the tasks as per requirements and I am using Ubuntu Linux 24.04 LTS version , let's start installing the tools.

# 1)YOSYS
 
 Yosys is an open-source logic synthesis tool used mainly in digital hardware design. Its purpose is to take a Register Transfer Level (RTL) description (usually written in Verilog) and translate it into a gate-level netlist that can be mapped to standard cell libraries, FPGAs, or other target technologies. Basically it is used for synthesis.

The following commands are used to install Yosys in Ubuntu linux environment

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ git clone https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys.git
$ cd yosys
$ sudo apt install make (If make is not installed please install it)
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential clang bison flex \
libreadline-dev gawk tcl-dev libffi-dev git \
graphviz xdot pkg-config python3 libboost-system-dev \
libboost-python-dev libboost-filesystem-dev zlib1g-dev
$ make config-gcc
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

# 2)IVERILOG

Icarus Verilog, commonly invoked by the command iverilog, is a powerful and popular open-source tool for simulating and synthesizing hardware designs written in the Verilog hardware description language (HDL). It serves as a complete toolchain, encompassing a Verilog compiler and a simulation runtime environment.

The following commands are used to install iverilog in Ubuntu linux environment

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install iverilog
```

# 3)GTKWAVE

GTKWave is a graphical tool used to visualize the timing diagrams (waveforms) of signals from a hardware simulation. It does not perform the simulation itself but reads the output files generated by simulators like Icarus Verilog, ModelSim, Vivado Simulator, and many others. Its primary purpose is to help you debug your design by visually inspecting how signals change over time.

The following commands are used to install gtkwave in Ubuntu Linux environment

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install gtkwave
```
